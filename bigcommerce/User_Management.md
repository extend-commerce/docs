**Note:** To create a new user in BigCommerce, navigate to `Customers â†’ Add Customer`. Enter the customer's details and the company name to associate the customer with that company. The new customer will subsequently appear on the customer listing page within the 'Extend Commerce' app.

**Note:** To register customers on the BigCommerce Store from the Storefront, users must have access to the Storefront link. If the store is not live, they will need the preview code, which can only be shared by the BigCommerce Account Owner.

When creating a customer from the Application, BigCommerce Account Users with access to the BigCommerce Portal can set the password for customers registering to the BigCommerce Store. The password can be set on the Customer Page in the BigCommerce Portal.
