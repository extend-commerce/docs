**Note:** To register customers on the BigCommerce Store from the Storefront, users must have access to the Storefront link. If the store is not live, they will need the preview code, which can only be shared by the BigCommerce Account Owner.

When a user created in the Extend Commerce app wants to access the storefront. They should use the email and password that were set during their creation in BigCommerce.
