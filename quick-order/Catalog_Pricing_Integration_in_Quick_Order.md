## Introduction

With **Quick Order**, your customers can now easily view the catalog pricing tailored to their needs. The app integrates seamlessly with your Shopify store to display any quantity rules and volume breaks you’ve set up for your products.

## Prerequisites

To get started ensure you have the following:
- **Shopify Plus account**: This is required to enable advanced catalog functionality.
- **Catalogs Created for Your Customers**: Set up customer-specific catalogs and pricing based on quantities and volume rules.

## How It Works

Quick Order automatically reflects the pricing configurations you've set up for your products, such as quantity rules and volume pricing. Here’s how the process works:

1. **Set Up Quantity Rules and Volume Breaks**: First, configure [quantity-based pricing and volume breaks](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/b2b/catalogs/quantity-pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com) for your products. These settings will be applied to each product in your catalog. 

2. **Customer Login**: When customers log into your store based on their location they will be shown the best-matched catalog with the relevant pricing.

3. **Visibility of Pricing and Quantity**: Once logged in, customers will see the updated catalog with accurate pricing and the associated quantity rules directly in the Quick Order interface.
