The dashboard is divided into two key sections:[ **Quick Order Setup**](https://docs.extendcommerce.com/quick-order/Quick_Order_Setup) and [**Manage Product Tables**](https://docs.extendcommerce.com/quick-order/Product_Tables_Setup), each designed to streamline your ordering processes.

## Quick Order Setup

Quick Order is a feature designed to make bulk purchasing faster and more efficient for your customers. By allowing them to upload or paste a CSV file with SKUs and quantities, Quick Order eases the process of adding multiple products to the cart without the need to browse through the store manually. This is especially useful for customers who place regular, large orders or need to reorder the same items frequently.

### Use Cases for Quick Order:

* **Wholesale Customers**: Businesses that need to purchase large quantities of the same products or restock regularly can benefit from Quick Order. For example, a retailer may need to order a set quantity of items like boxes of supplies, or a restaurant might need to reorder ingredients in bulk.

* **Frequent Reorders**: Customers who place orders for the same set of products each time can save time by uploading a CSV with their regular order details. For instance, a customer who orders the same set of parts or products every month can upload the CSV file instead of manually adding items to the cart.

* **Time-Saving for Large Orders**: For customers placing bulk orders, the Quick Order feature eliminates the need to navigate the entire store catalog. By uploading a CSV or pasting the content directly, they can quickly populate their cart and proceed to checkout.

## Additional Product Tables

In addition to the Quick Order feature, **Product Tables** provide a way to manage and display your products in a structured tabular format. If you want to use additional product tables beyond the one linked to Quick Order, you can easily create and manage them within our application. This allows you to add products directly to the cart from any table without relying solely on the Quick Order feature.

You can also opt to use just the product tables without the Quick Order feature, which is perfect for showcasing specific product collections directly in your store and adding them to the cart in bulk with a click. These tables can be fully customized to meet your needs, whether for specific product groups or larger catalog displays.

### Use Cases for Product Tables:

* **Bulk Ordering with Product Tables**: If you have multiple product tables set up, customers can quickly browse and add products to their cart from any of them.

* **Customizing Product Displays**: If you have different types of products or need to organize them into distinct collections (e.g., seasonal items, wholesale products), product tables give you full flexibility to display and manage them in a user-friendly table format.

* **No Quick Order Needed?**: If you prefer not to use the Quick Order feature but still want a fast way to add products to the cart, using standalone product tables can give you the same efficiency and customization, minus the CSV upload feature.
